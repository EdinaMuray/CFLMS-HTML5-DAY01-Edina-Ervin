   		Fast & Furious (originally The Fast and the Furious) is a media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with illegal street racing, heists and spies. The franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows, video games and theme park attractions. It is distributed by Universal Pictures.

		The first film was released in 2001, which began the original trilogy of films focused on racing, and culminated in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). The series went under a change with Fast & Furious (2009), which transitioned the series toward heists and spying, and was followed by four sequels. F9 is set to be released in 2021, with a tenth planned. The main films are collectively known as The Fast Saga.

			Universal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the animated web television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.

			The series has been commercially successful and is Universal's biggest franchise, as of 2015 ranking as the ninth-highest-grossing film series of all time with a combined gross of over $5 billion.[1] Critical reception was mostly mixed to negative for the first four films, while later films in the series were more positively received. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood, live shows, commercials, many video games and toys. It is considered the vehicle that propelled lead actors Vin Diesel and Paul Walker to stardom.[2]
