    	<h2>Story</h2>

					
    	<p>
   		A classic car is an older automobile, typically 20 years or older, though definitions vary.[note 1] The common theme is of an older car of sufficient historical interest to be collectable and worth preserving or restoring rather than scrapping.
   		</p>

   		<p>
		Organizations such as the Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) and the Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars that are called "classic". These are described as "fine" or "distinctive" automobile, either American or foreign built, produced between 1915 and 1948.
